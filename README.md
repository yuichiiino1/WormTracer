# WormTracer

WormTracer is an algorithm designed to accurately determine the centerline of a worm in time-lapse images. Unlike conventional methods that analyze individual images separately, WormTracer estimates worm centerlines within a sequence of images concurrently. This process enables the resolution of complex postures that are difficult to assess when treated as isolated images. The centerlines obtained through WormTracer exhibit higher accuracy compared to those acquired using conventional methods.

WormTracer codes are written in Python and provided in two forms, as an IPython Notebook (.ipynb), or a Python source code (.py). Users can choose either format depending on their own environment for running the codes.
